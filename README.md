## Presentation

### Selected topic: 
Carbon emmissions effects on severe weather events in the United States

The population of a country is closely related to the output of carbon emissions

### Questions to answer:              
Does Worldwide carbon emissions have effect of severe weather in the United States?

## Database
  
- A PostgreSQL instance has been created on the Google Cloud platform
- Connection from our local pgAdmin to the Google Cloud PostgreSQL instance has been established
- An empty database has been created; tables incoming shortly




## Machine Learning



We will attempt to use Linear Regression and Random Forest to test the data.
