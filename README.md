## Carbon Emissions and Severe Weather: Is It Raining Cats and Dogs?

### *Presentation*


#### Selected topic: 
Carbon emmissions effects on severe weather events in the United States

#### Reason why the topic was selected: 
Carbon emmision effects on the environment has risen dramatically over the last few decades.  The population and economic ranking of a country is closely related to its output of carbon emissions.  We wanted to see if a correlation between world-wide emissions and severe weather in the United States could be found and use to predict weather events.

#### Questions to answer:              
- Does Worldwide carbon emissions have an effect on severe weather in the United States?
- How does the population of a country effect the output of carbon emissions?
- Does the emissions from the United States have a stronger impact on the U.S. weather than world emissions?  

### *Data Sources*  
  #### Available Files
  - The World Bank - CO2 emissions 1960-2018 https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EN.ATM.CO2E.PC
  - Storm events data: https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/pub/data/swdi/stormevents/csvfiles/ 
  - Co2 data: https://github.com/owid/co2-data </br></br></br>  


### *Database*
  
- A PostgreSQL instance has been created on the Google Cloud platform  
- Connection from our local pgAdmin to the Google Cloud PostgreSQL instance has been established  
- A database and 2 tables have been created to store Severe Weather Events and Worldwide Co2 Emissions since 1950

### *Machine Learning*  

- Machine learning models are set up based on the combined datasets of co2 emissions and severe weather
- Data sets were joined on the "Year" column
- Machine learning algorithms to be tested are SKLearn's "Linear Regression" and imblearn.ensemble's "RandomForestClassifier"



### *Dashboard*  

Use Tableau to create visualizations showing trends/patterns

### *Communication Protocol*

We all plan to meet Monday through Thursday evenings and Saturday afternoons, through Google Meet. During the times we do not meet over Google Meet, we communicate via Slack, and have a shared google doc that each member can edit at any given time.
