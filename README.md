### Presentation


#### Selected topic: 
Carbon emmissions effects on severe weather events in the United States

#### Reason why the topic was selected: 
Carbon emmision effects on the environment has been on the steady rise
The population of a country is closely related to the output of carbon emissions

#### Questions to answer:              
Does Worldwide carbon emissions have effect of severe weather in the United States?
How does the population of a country effect the output of carbon emissions?
