## Carbon Emissions and Severe Weather: Is It Raining Cats and Dogs?

### *Presentation*


#### Selected topic: 
Carbon emmissions effects on severe weather events in the United States

#### Reason why the topic was selected: 
Carbon emmision effects on the environment has risen dramatically over the last few decades.  The population and economic ranking of a country is closely related to its output of carbon emissions.  We wanted to see if a correlation between world-wide emissions and severe weather in the United States could be found and use to predict weather events.

#### Questions to answer:              
- Does Worldwide carbon emissions have an effect on severe weather in the United States?
- How does the population of a country effect the output of carbon emissions?
- Does the emissions from the United States have a stronger impact on the U.S. weather than world emissions?

We all plan to meet Monday through Thursday evenings and Saturday afternoons, through Google Meet. During the times we do not meet over Google Meet, we communicate via Slack, and have a shared google doc that each member can edit at any given time.
